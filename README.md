IFCopenHouse: Lantern_Hollow
============

A site/project specific evolution of the [IFCopenHouse](http://blog.ifcopenshell.org/2012/11/say-hi-to-ifcopenhouse.html)--striving to push #openBIM even further.

============
We are always looking to collaborate with a select team of individuals who are also excited about the benefits of working  <a href="#in-the-open">in the open</a> and pushing the bounds of existing and new IFC workflows.

One of our mantra's is, "Specialize, Specialize, Specialize!".  Over the years we would like to build a trusted network of highly specialized collaborators agile enough to tackle the most obscure problems.

####In-the-Open

All of OpeningDesign's projects are conducted out in the open.  That is, during the development of any one project, all team communication and content is hosted [publicly](https://github.com/OpeningDesign) and is <a href="#license">open source</a>.

Since we believe that [innovation happens elsewhere](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS591US591&ion=1&espv=&ie=UTF-8&q=innovation%20happens%20elsewhere) we would like to lower, as much as we can, the barrier for others to collaborate and contribute.
