### Program
From Owner 7/15/2014...
* updated trim & doors
* get rid of paneling and replace with accent walls of different materials (metal, barn board, drywall, etc)
* Master suite & Master bath addition, we are just not sure of moving that into the living room and not having that space on the main floor ... we just aren't sure how to visualize therefore we just don't know.  
* 4 season room (spacious) with swinging chair, possible fireplace.
* We do not need a formal dining room per se, but would be nice to have the space for larger dinner parties/holidays.
* would like a family room and a living room space
